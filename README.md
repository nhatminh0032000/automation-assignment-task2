# Guide to run your automation test scripts

I have created a maven project with TestNG, adding necessary dependencies to pom.xml. 

Step 1: Prerequisite for running

    Java should be installed.  Version Java 8 sdk
    Selenium- 3.141.59
    Maven should be installed. - apache-maven-3.8.4
    Using TestNG framework for Test Cases - 7.0.0-beta1

Step 2: Download test scripts from github and unzip
  E.g: F:\Automation\Assignment_Demo-master

Step 3: Open command prompt.

Step 4: Set MavenProject folder as working directory In command prompt.

Step 5:  Run “mvn compile” command In command prompt as bellow

Step 6:  Run “mvn clean test -Dsurefire.suiteXmlFiles=testng.xml” command In command prompt. This will run the test scripts. 

Step 7: After performing step 6, the system will create a folder called “target” in the folder containing source code. (e.g: F:\Automation\Assignment_Demo-master\target). In the “target” folder, open the “surefire-reports” folder and then open the “Index.html” file

Step 8: On the report screen, click on “Reporter output” on the left side to see details of two test cases which have been run.
